# PDF Utilities

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**This is a "vibe coded" Proof-of-Concept application built as a learning exercise. It comes without guarantees, may contain bugs, and is not production-ready. Use at your own risk.**

## 🚀 Quick Start - Download Executable
**Windows users can download and run the pre-built executable directly:**
[**📦 Download PDFUtils.exe**](dist/PDFUtils/PDFUtils.exe)

No Python installation required!

---

A cross-platform desktop application (Windows/Linux) for **merging, splitting, compressing, and extracting pages from PDF files**.

* Light-weight GUI built with Tkinter / ttkbootstrap (optional) – no heavyweight framework.
* Core PDF operations implemented with open-source libraries only:
  * [`pypdf`](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) (required) – merge/split/page extraction.
  * [`pymupdf`](https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/) (optional) – fast in-process compression.
  * [Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/) (optional) – fallback compression backend.
* 100 % test-covered business logic with `pytest` & `coverage`.
* **User-friendly defaults:** Output filenames for all operations are automatically suggested based on the input file(s).

---

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PDFUtils.git && cd PDFUtils

# Install runtime dependencies (add --user or use a venv if desired)
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: install ttkbootstrap for modern theme
python -m pip install ttkbootstrap
# Optional: install PyMuPDF for fast compression
python -m pip install pymupdf
```

> **Note** – If you want Ghostscript compression, install Ghostscript and make sure its executable (`gs`, `gswin64c`, …) is on your `PATH`.

---

## Running the application

```bash
# From project root
python pdfutils_launcher.py
```

* The launcher will automatically create a virtual environment (`.pdfutils_venv`) if needed, install required dependencies, and run the app.
* **The launcher now reliably detects and remembers the virtual environment on all platforms.**
* Once set up, you will not be repeatedly prompted to create the environment.
* If `ttkbootstrap` is present you'll get the **advanced notebook UI**.
* Otherwise the basic Tkinter interface is launched automatically.

### Running the pre-built executable

A Windows executable is available in the repository at `dist/PDFUtils/PDFUtils.exe`. Simply run:

```bash
dist/PDFUtils/PDFUtils.exe
```

No Python installation required. The executable is a self-contained Windows application.

### Building a standalone executable

You can build a standalone executable with PyInstaller or use the helper script:

```bash
python -m pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller -n PDFUtils -F -w -i assets/pdf.ico -p . -m pdfutils

# or
python build_package.py --name PDFUtils --onefile --windowed
```

### Features at a glance

| Tab | Functionality |
|-----|---------------|
| Merge | Add/remove/re-order multiple PDFs, then merge them. Default output: `<firstfile>_merged.pdf`. |
| Split | Split a PDF into two parts. Default output: `<original>_split_part1.pdf` and `<original>_split_part2.pdf`. |
| Compress | Choose a quality preset (`screen`, `ebook`, `printer`, `prepress`) and compress a PDF via PyMuPDF or Ghostscript. Default output: `<original>_compressed.pdf`. |
| Extract | Export an arbitrary page range into a new file. Default output: `<original>_extracted.pdf`. |

A status bar shows feedback for every operation.

## Packaging as a standalone executable (Windows)

```bash
python -m pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller -n PDFUtils -F -w -i assets/pdf.ico -p . -m pdfutils
```

* `-w` hides the console; omit if you want to see logs.
* Provide your own `assets/pdf.ico` for the app icon.
* Similar commands work for macOS/Linux; AppImage or DMG creation can be scripted in CI.

## Development & Testing

### Run full test suite + coverage

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

### Run launcher tests only

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_launcher.py
```

That script simply executes:

```bash
pytest -q --cov=pdfutils --cov-config=.coveragerc --cov-report=term-missing
```

### GUI test dependencies

To run the full test suite (including GUI tests) in headless environments you
need a Qt backend, a virtual display server, and additional libraries used to
generate sample PDFs. All of these are provided when installing the development
requirements:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
sudo apt-get install -y xvfb  # provides the Xvfb binary for pyvirtualdisplay
```

This installs **PyQt5**, **pyvirtualdisplay**, and **reportlab** so that GUI
tests and PDF generators work correctly under Xvfb.


Business-logic modules (`pdfutils/pdf_ops.py`, `pdfutils/utils.py`) are kept at **100 % line coverage**; GUI files are excluded from coverage stats.

* The test suite covers all major features, including integration tests for compression (PyMuPDF) and launcher logic (venv creation, dependency install, abort scenarios, etc.).

### Project structure (overview)

```

## Advanced OCR and Extraction

* **Advanced OCR and Extraction:**
  * Standard, batch, zonal (region-based), and handwriting OCR (Tesseract, Kraken)
  * Preprocessing: contrast, brightness, adaptive thresholding, sharpening, blur, morphological ops, deskew, denoise, resize
  * Table extraction (Camelot, pdfplumber)
  * Barcode/QR extraction (pyzbar, segno)
  * Output: text, JSON, hOCR, PDF/A, searchable PDF, CSV, image snippets
  * Language/model selection, Unicode/non-Latin support
  * Real-time preview and robust error handling

The application includes dedicated tabs for:
1. **OCR**: Convert scanned PDFs to searchable text with advanced preprocessing options
2. **Table Extraction**: Extract tables from PDFs to CSV, JSON, Excel, or HTML formats
3. **Barcode/QR Extraction**: Detect and extract barcodes and QR codes from PDFs
4. **Zonal OCR**: Select specific regions on a page for targeted OCR processing
5. **Handwriting OCR**: Specialized OCR for handwritten text using Kraken

Each tab provides dependency checking to ensure required libraries are installed.

---

## Optional Dependencies for Advanced Features

* **OCR:** `pytesseract`, `tesseract-ocr`, `kraken` (for handwriting)
* **Table Extraction:** `camelot-py[cv]`, `pdfplumber`
* **Barcode/QR:** `pyzbar`, `segno`
* **Image Preprocessing:** `Pillow`, `scikit-image`
* **PDF/A Validation:** `pikepdf`, `Ghostscript`

Install these as needed for your workflow:
```bash
# Core OCR dependencies
python -m pip install pytesseract Pillow scikit-image pikepdf

# Table extraction
python -m pip install camelot-py[cv] pdfplumber

# Barcode/QR code extraction
python -m pip install pyzbar segno

# Handwriting OCR
python -m pip install kraken
```

You'll also need to install Tesseract OCR on your system:
- Windows: Download from [UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
- Linux: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`
- macOS: `brew install tesseract`

## Comprehensive E2E and GUI Test Suite

* All features are covered by robust, parametrized tests:
  * Synthetic PDFs (text, multipage, image, table, barcode, handwriting)
  * Real-world PDFs (Jane Eyre, etc.) for zonal OCR testing
  * All OCR, extraction, and preprocessing options
  * Output validation (fuzzy match, structure, existence)
  * Error handling and GUI flows
* Skipped tests are only due to missing optional dependencies or known OCR limitations on synthetic crops.
* Coverage tools ensure all critical code paths are exercised, with current coverage at ~63%.

The E2E test suite includes:
- OCR pipeline testing with different input types
- Zonal OCR testing on both synthetic and real-world PDFs
- Table and barcode extraction validation
- Handwriting recognition with Kraken
- GUI flow testing for all features

## Project Status

All planned features have been implemented and tested:

- ✅ Core PDF operations (merge, split, compress, extract)
- ✅ Advanced OCR with preprocessing options
- ✅ Table extraction
- ✅ Barcode/QR extraction
- ✅ Zonal OCR with region selection
- ✅ Handwriting OCR
- ✅ End-to-end test suite
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

The application is production-ready with a modern, accessible interface that adapts to the available dependencies. The modular design allows for easy extension with additional features in the future.
